- **Vector** = logos, icons, UI assets you’ll scale. Use for kite logo, diamonds, stars, badges.
- **Image** = illustrations, backgrounds, characters, marketing art. Use for hero art, cards, social images.
- **Icon** = small, clear symbols. Use for challenge types, rewards, in-app icons.
- Add **“transparent background”** when you need PNGs for overlay.
- Add **“no text”** if you’ll add type in Figma/Canva/code.
- For strict brand match, regenerate with hex colors in the prompt (e.g. “purple #6C5CE7”).
- Export at 2x or 3x for sharpness on retina (e.g. 1024px for a 512px app icon).
