## Tips for Leonardo.ai

- **Aspect ratio:** Use 1:1 for icons and profile art, 16:9 for banners/desktop, 9:16 for mobile/stories.
- **Model:** Try “Leonardo Diffusion” or “Anime Pastel Dream” for illustration; “PhotoReal” only if you need near-photo (usually not for this brand).
- **Negative prompt:** Always add at least “text, realistic, dark” to avoid unwanted text and mood.
- **Upscale:** After generation, use Leonardo’s upscaler for print or high-DPI assets.
- **Variations:** Use “Image to Image” or “Variations” to refine a result you like.
- **Consistency:** For character consistency, generate one hero image you like, then use it as reference in “Image to Image” with a new pose description.
