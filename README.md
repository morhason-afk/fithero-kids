## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Email Notifications Setup

To enable email notifications for weekly goals, you need to configure Resend:

1. **Sign up for Resend** (free tier available):
   - Go to https://resend.com
   - Create an account and verify your email
   - Navigate to API Keys and create a new API key

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env.local
   
   # Add your Resend API key
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   
   # Optional: Set a custom "from" email (must be verified domain)
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=Exercise Game <noreply@yourdomain.com>
   ```

3. **For production** (Vercel/Netlify):
   - Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to your environment variables in the deployment dashboard
   - Optionally add `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` if you have a verified domain

**Note**: Without the API key configured, email notifications will fall back to opening the default email client.

npm run build

# Start production server

```
